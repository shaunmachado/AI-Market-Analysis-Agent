"""Answer questions about saved reports with Claude, using retrieval (RAG).

For each question it gathers, within a size limit:
1. Figures across days for any watchlist ticker named in the question.
2. The events calendar: everything in the next 30 days, plus the last 30 days for named tickers.
3. The passages from any report that best match the question, found by
   search_index.py (keywords plus meaning), so older reports are reachable.
4. The 10 most recent reports in full, plus recent reports where a named ticker was flagged.
Claude is told to answer from that material alone and to cite report dates.

Rules:
- Use only the reports, passages and figures provided. If they don't contain the answer, say so plainly.
- Cite the report date for every claim, like (2026-11-05). Passages carry the date of the report they came from.
- Every number must come from the provided material. Never estimate or calculate new figures.
- Intraday reports describe moves "so far" that day, and those figures may have changed since.
- Dated events come from the events calendar: cite them as (calendar), and say so when a date isn't confirmed.
- This is research, not investment advice. Never recommend buying or selling.
- Keep answers short: a few sentences or a short list, in markdown."""
